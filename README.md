<details><summary><h3>🌞 What is bluepilot?</h3></summary>

---

[bluepilot](https://github.com/bluepilotdev/bluepilot) is a fork of the hugely popular SunnyPilot project for the Comma3 and Comma3X.  The goal of BluePilot is to develop, test, and stage Ford specific enhancements, validating them before submission to the SunnyPilot team for inclusion in the parent project.

</details>

<details><summary><h3>⛔ Prohibited Safety Modifications</h3></summary>

---

All [official sunnypilot branches](https://github.com/sunnyhaibin/sunnypilot/branches) strictly adhere to [comma.ai's safety policy](https://github.com/commaai/openpilot/blob/master/docs/SAFETY.md). Any changes that go against this policy will result in your fork and your device being banned from both comma.ai and sunnypilot channels. This same stipulation applies to all bluepilot instances as well.

The following changes are a **VIOLATION** of this policy and **ARE NOT** included in any sunnypilot branches:
* Driver Monitoring:
    * ❌ "Nerfing" or reducing monitoring parameters.
* Panda safety:
    * ❌ No preventing disengaging of <ins>**LONGITUDINAL CONTROL**</ins> (acceleration/brake) on brake pedal press.
    * ❌ No auto re-engaging of <ins>**LONGITUDINAL CONTROL**</ins> (acceleration/brake) on brake pedal release.
    * ❌ No disengaging on ACC MAIN in OFF state.

<details><summary><h3>⚒ Installation</h3></summary>

Please refer to [Recommended Branches](#-recommended-branches) to find your preferred/supported branch. This guide will assume you want to install the latest `stable` branch.

* bluepilot not installed
  1. [Factory reset/uninstall](https://github.com/commaai/openpilot/wiki/FAQ#how-can-i-reset-the-device) the previous software if you have another software/fork installed.
  2. After factory reset/uninstall and upon reboot, select `Custom Software` when given the option.
  3. Input the installation URL per [Recommended Branches](#-recommended-branches). Example: ```https://bit.ly/bp-stable``` [^4] (note: `https://` is not requirement on the comma three)
  4. Complete the rest of the installation following the onscreen instructions.

* bluepilot already installed and you installed a version after 0.8.17?
  1. On the comma three, go to `Settings` ▶️ `Software`.
  2. At the `Download` option, press `CHECK`. This will fetch the list of latest branches from sunnypilot.
  3. At the `Target Branch` option, press `SELECT` to open the Target Branch selector.
  4. Scroll to select the desired branch per [Recommended Branches](#-recommended-branches). Example: `stable`

|    Branch    |         Installation URL         |
|:------------:|:--------------------------------:|
| `stable` | https://bit.ly/bp-stable |
| `staging` | https://bit.ly/bp-staging |

<details><summary><h3>🚗 BluePilot Specific Features</h3></summary>

---
In addition to all sunnypilot features, bluepilot incorporates the following Ford specific enhacements.

- [**Improved Ford Longitudinal controls**] - logic to adjust stock OpenPilot single acceleration signal into seperate gas and brake signals for much smoother long control on ford vehicles.
- [**Anti-Windup in Turns**] - Logic to reset the EPAS back to zero when a human turn is detected.  This prevents the EPAS from winding up and fighting to keep turning after the car has straightened up.  Makes experimental mode and MADS safer to use.
- [**OEM Style Lateral Control Logic**] - This is a complete rewrite of the lateral control logic to match the behavior of the OEM EPAS system.  It includes a blend of desired curvature and predicted curvature to achieve smoother signals, incorporation of curvature_rate signal to help with getting in and out of curves more ontime and the path_offset and path_angle variables to increase the available steering torque and to allow for custom in lane positioning as well as enabling the legacy sunnypilot style lanefull mode.
- [**Improved Lane Change Logic**] - Even further improvements to the lange change logic to help fix issues with the older logic that caused the lane change to overshoot and then have to correct back.

The following settings and tuning are available in the BluePilot menu (after complete one drive in a Ford vehnicle)

- [**Show Hands Free UI**] - This setting enables the hands free Blue Cruise dash.  This will only work in vehicles with a digital dash that can display the icon.  Known to work in Mach E, Lightning, Ranger, and F150s with digital dash.
- [**Send Lane Depature Signals**] - This sends the lane depature alerts to the dash on vehicles with a supporting dash.
- [**Send Driver Monitor Signals**] For vehicles with the Blue Cruise dash, this will send the pay attention alerts to the dash.
- [**Enable Human Turn Detection**] - This setting enables the human turn detection logic.  This will help prevent the EPAS from winding up and fighting to keep turning after the car has straightened up.  Makes experimental mode and MADS safer to use.
- [**Lane Change Factor**] - This is a tunable reduction in lane change signal to enable less aggressive lane changes.  Lower numbers equal slower lane changes.  Too low and the lane chagne might fail.
- [**Use Advanced Lateral Control**] - This settings enables the OEM style logic with path_offset and path_angle variables.  This allows for custom in lane positioning. Disabling this setting will revert to only using curvature and curvature_rate which was the previous behavior in bluepilot 1.0
- [**Tuning Profile**] - There are 3 preset tuning profiles which can be used to adjust the behavior of the lateral control logic for specific vehicles and driving preferences. There is also the option to choose a custom profile which will allow you to fine tune the behavior of the lateral control logic to your liking.  Most CAN (Q3) vehicles should probalby start with mid or high profile.  CANFD (Q4) vehicles should probably start with low or mid profile.  The values for each profile are listed in the individual tuning parameter descriptions below.
- [**Enable Legacy Style Lanefull Mode**] - This setting enables the legacy style lanefull mode which will use lane lines to determine the ideal path for the vehicle rather than Commas model.  This setting is only applicable when linelines are strong and the lane width is not too wide.
- [**In lane offset**] - This setting allows for custom in lane positioning.  Negative numbers will move the car to the left, positive numbers will move the car to the right.
- [**Predicted Curvature Blend Ratio**] - This setting allows for a blend of desired curvature and predicted curvature to achieve smoother signals.  Lower numbers will make steering more aggressive.  To tune this value, set PATH ANGLE AMPLITUDE and PATH ANGLE IN-CURVE REDUCTION to 0.0, then begin to increase the blend ratio until the car starts to "wander" or experience a slow ping pong effect at highway speeds.  It is not desired for this number to be low enough for complete control, because if the signal is too strong it will conflict with the other signals. Default Values are Low = 0.6, Mid = 0.5, High = 0.4
- [**Path Angle Amplitude**] - This setting controls how aggressive the path_angle signal is applied to correct for deviations from the ideal path.  To tune this number, first find the ideal value of PREDICTED CURVATURE BLEND RATIO, then begin to increase until the car starts to feel "twitchy" or experiences a very fast ping pong effect at highway speeds.  Then reduce the number until the car is smooth and stable. Default Values are Low = 2.5, Mid = 5.0, High = 7.0
- [**Path Angle in-Curve Reduction**] - This setting controls how aggressive the path_angle signal is applied to correct for deviations from the ideal path while in curves. It is a fraction of the amount of path angle applied on straightaways.  To tune this number, first find the ideal value of PATH ANGLE AMPLITUDE, then begin to increase until the car starts to feel "twitchy" or experience a very fast ping pong effect in curves at highway speeds.  Then reduce the number until the car is smooth and stable in curves at highway speeds. Default Values are Low = 0.20, Mid = 0.35, High = 0.50
